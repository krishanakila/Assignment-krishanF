<h2 mat-dialog-title class="head-title-main">2020 Census questionnaire.</h2>


<p class="head-title">Before you answer Question 1, count the people living in this
    house, apartment, or mobile home using our guidelines.</p>
    <p class="head-title-sub">• Count all people, including babies, who live and sleep here
        most of the time.</p>
    <p class="head-title-sub">• If no one lives and sleeps at this address most of the time, go
    online at my2020census.gov or call the number on page 8</p>


<p class="head-title">The census must also include people without a permanent
place to live, so.</p>
    <p class="head-title-sub">• If someone who does not have a permanent place to live is
staying here on April 1, 2020, count that person.</p>


<p class="head-title">The Census Bureau also conducts counts in institutions and
other places, so:</p>
    <p class="head-title-sub">• Do not count anyone living away from here, either at college
or in the Armed Forces.</p>

    <p class="head-title-sub">• Do not count anyone in a nursing home, jail, prison, detention
facility, etc., on April 1, 2020.</p>

  <p class="head-title-sub">• Leave these people off your questionnaire, even if they will
return to live here after they leave college, the nursing home,
the military, jail, etc. Otherwise, they may be counted twice.</p>
